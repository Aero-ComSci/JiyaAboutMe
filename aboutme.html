          <p>Driven by my interest in science and technology I aspire to use my skills in programming to help create useful solutions to real world problems as well as helping enhance user technology to make an effective advancement. Inspired by many family members who surround me and their impact in the technological field, I want to find a median of both my marketing as well as computational skills. In the short term, I aim to gain more knowledge on various programming languages and explore outside extracurriculars in the engineering and computer science field. In the long term, I plan to complete the computer science pathway along with securing internships in software development as I become more knowledgeable in certain areas. To achieve these skills, my course of action entails working on new projects and collaborating with experienced professionals in the field.

        <h5>Strengths and Personal Qualities:</h5>
        <div class="w3-container">
           <p>My interactions with my peers have always been positive. I find myself to be very creative and always a person who you can count on for a helping hand. Along with that, I am always super curious to see what way I can make a difference in whatever I'm doing and try to help out as much as I can. Whether it be a group project, or I'm helping out a friend with whatever they need. This includes projects that can be quite tedious, that I find myself to be very interested in experimenting and finding ways to enhance the user experience. </p>

        <h5>Extracurriculars and Acheivments:</h5>
        <div class="w3-container">
          <p>As a student some major milestones for me included graduating from middle school with the California Junior Scholarship Federation gold seal student, where I worked to fundraise and volunteer to help local charities and support our own services. With this opportunity I was able to learn more about collaborating with others as well as help my community in an impactful way. Along with that, I am currently volunteering at the local Library as a member of their leadership group, the Teen Advisory Group, and help maintain and offer new events for people of all ages to participate in. With volunteer work at these organizations as well as other organizations as well as non profits, I have not only strengthened my communication skills but also my leadership capabilities. Some other extracurriculars I participate include the Emerald High School chapter of DECA where we participate in competitions to strengthen our view of marketing and specialize in working on our speaking skill and working under time constraints. As well as, my high school robotics team where we work as a team to collaborate and create new ideas to make our mechanisms more efficient and effective under challenges and constraints.
